# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started The Odin Project,  and learned about web technologies. Much of it I already knew, but it was refreshing to review. I also learned how to use git and practiced a simple git workflow.

**Thoughts** I forgot how much I loved using the terminal for so many things - it was great to work through a git workflow using it.

### Day 2: January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the HTML/CSS Sections on The Odin Project (TOP). Reviewed Mozilla's docs for overviews on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Started freecodecamp (2nd time) and picked back where I left off (Responsive web design)

**Thoughts** Surprised to be using freecodecamp again! I love this resource. I can't wait to migrate  my previous mini-projects onto git.

### Day 3: January 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed with FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Certification - worked through Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web and Design Principles, CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.

**Thoughts** I enjoyed learning about CSS Flexbox and Grid - these were always so mysterious to me when I first started years ago. It was also really great to learn about Accessibility and all the ways web developers must keep in mind the edge various of certain users, and how important these are for designing inclusively.

### Day 4: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some more of CSS Grid, then started working on self-building a blog to apply some of the learnings. 

**Thoughts** It's amazing how beautiful a website can look by just employing minimalism. There's a lot to go here, I want to: add infinite scroll and media, a nice way to upload my writing, and some basic SEO. Also, I need a solid workflow for building websites - I was switching off from HTML to styling too much, and it feels like I could have created this in 1/3 the time (though it did only take about an hour).

### Day 5: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on the self-blog. Added styling  using CSS  grid.

**Thoughts** Didn't get to code as much as I'd like today - work demands took precedence. Starting new role as Product Manager tomorrow.

### Day 6: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added icons and used CSS Flexbox to style them appropriately. Left side-bar now has a good skeleton; next need to add in the right side's infinite scroll & content management pieces. 

**Thoughts** It's amazing how much faster my workflow is using CLI and google. I also learn more when I push myself to apply concepts and build using vision as opposed to "stealing like an artist" and drawing inspiration from others' websites. There's certainly a tradeoff here between originality and speed. For now, the answer is speed. I do not want HTML/CSS to be my core expertise; they'll come over time. I want my core expertise  as a dev to be in JS and more back-end languages.
