# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started The Odin Project,  and learned about web technologies. Much of it I already knew, but it was refreshing to review. I also learned how to use git and practiced a simple git workflow.

**Thoughts** I forgot how much I loved using the terminal for so many things - it was great to work through a git workflow using it.

### Day 1: January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the HTML/CSS Sections on The Odin Project (TOP). Reviewed Mozilla's docs for overviews on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Started freecodecamp (2nd time) and picked back where I left off (Responsive web design)

**Thoughts** Surprised to be using freecodecamp again! I love this resource. I can't wait to migrate  my previous mini-projects onto git.

### Day 1: January 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed with FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Certification - worked through Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web and Design Principles, CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.

**Thoughts** I enjoyed learning about CSS Flexbox and Grid - these were always so mysterious to me when I first started years ago. It was also really great to learn about Accessibility and all the ways web developers must keep in mind the edge various of certain users, and how important these are for designing inclusively.
